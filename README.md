METIS Pipeline Test Data
========================

This repository contains some test data for the METIS Pipeline. It should contain preferably small data.

The idea is that this is a temporary solution to get started until we have a more final place for the test data.

This is in a separate repository with the idea that we do not really care about the history and do not want to pollute other repositories.

We should try to make the data reproducible though, so that we can easily recreate it. E.g. by running a tagged version of the METIS Simulations repository.
